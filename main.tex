    	\begin{block}{Introduction}
    		
            Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) have been listed by China's Ministry of Ecology and Environment (MEE) as key pollutants to be controlled in the series plans since 2013, for they play important roles in 
            the formation of secondary PM2.5 and troposphere ozone. In most Chemical Transport Model (CTM), errors in emissions could have even larger impacts on forecast than initial conditions(IC)\parencite{Sandu_2011}, and the uncertainty of VOCs emission can reach up to 78\% \parencite{Li_2017}. Thus, it can be expected that a better inversion of VOC emissions could have great impacts on PM2.5 and ozone forecasts.
            \newline
            Data assimilation tries to get better estimates based on prior information and observations. Ensemble-based filter is one of the main approaches in atmospheric data assimilation, and many efforts have been devoted to seeking for better VOC estimate using ensemble-based filter(for example, \parencite{Tang_2011, Ma_2019, Xing_2020}). For lacking direct observations of VOC, the common approach is using other correlated observations(usually ozone) to update all VOCs IC/emission via cross-variable assimilation. This approach is convenient to realize, but ignore the differences among VOC species and can thus bring in extra errors in some cases. Also, this approach can hardly use other observations which show no obvious correlation with all VOCs, since conducting cross-variable assimilation between variables with nonlinear relations can be dangerous and can even make the assimilation system diverge (see, for example, \parencite{Tang_2016})
            \newline
            We are trying to make a selection for VOC species to be updated based on correlations and potential influence. This selection will respect the different characters among VOCs, and can include more 'not so correlated' observations into assimilation system. The emission estimation will be tested by launching series of 72h forecasts using WRF-Chem V3.6.1.

					\item \textbf{surface chemical observation}: MEE in-situ observation for $PM_{2.5}, PM_{10}, SO_2, NO_2, O_3, CO$. A subset of 560 stations is selected in order to avoid observation correlation. Chemical observation will be assimilated hourly.

			\begin{block}{Methodology for emission inversion}
				
                In order to get emission inversion, we extend emission scaling factors $\lambda$ as part of WRF-Chem model state variables, and it will be integrated by using the ensemble forecast chemical concentration fields produced by WRF-Chem. The flow chat below describes this framework.  
 
                \begin{figure}
                    \centerline{\includegraphics[width=30pc,angle=0,scale=2.5]{figure/Methodology.png}}
                    \caption{(a) describe the framework to integrate scaling factor $\lambda$. (b) flow chart of the data assimilation system that simultaneously optimizes the chemical initial
                    conditions and emissions.}\label{fig2}
                \end{figure}

                % After been integrated and assimilated, the estimated emission $E^a$ can now be calculated by prescribed emission $E^p$ and $\lambda^a$ as:
                % \begin{equation}
                %     E^a=\lambda^a*E^{p} 
                % \end{equation}

                    {\includegraphics[width=0.6\colwidth,angle=0,scale=1]{figure/VOC_factor_domainavg.png}}
                    \caption{Normalized VOC factor for each observation kind. VOCs with a red name will be included in our assimilation system.}\label{fig_voc_factor}
                \end{figure}
                A quantified standard will make it clear to decide which VOC species should be assimilated. Here, we propose a VOC factor to quantify which VOC species should be included in the assimilation system. The VOC factor considers two parts:
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item correlation between observation and VOC species
                    \item the potential influence of updating VOC species on other variables
                \end{itemize}        
                A 50-member ensemble of free forecasts without any assimilation is conducted from 2022-07-10:00 to 2022-08-10:00 to calculate these factors(and also provide spin-up IC for cycling assimilation). Details about the calculation can be seen at the QR code in Appendix.

               We designed four experiments to explore the effects of VOCs selection in assimilation: \texttt{no\_voc, o3\_allvoc, o3\_5pctvoc, allobs\_avgvoc}. The meteorology variables and six main pollutions(including NOx), together with the emission scaling factors, will be updated by their corresponding observations in all experiments, which is the same in \parencite{Peng_2020}. The only difference between the four experiments is the strategy to assimilate VOC species, which is shown in the table below.

                    \item The daily change of VOC emission after selected updates is consistent with Ozone's daily change, and the updated emission peak in daytime can help the model to overcome the underestimation of Ozone simulation shown in \cref{fcst_result}
